# Madis
    Madis = Mac + Redis
---

## Description

This is a Redis client for Mac, built entirely with Swift to provide a native Mac experience. This project is still actively under development, so it's not ready for production use. **Please do not use it in your production environment, as it does not support any cursor and fragmentation to get the key/value of Redis, which may crash your Redis server!!!**

## Intention

I'm a backend developer with limited experience in frontend development. However, I am attracted to the UI effects in most macOS apps, so I thought of building my own and trying out SwiftUI. Nowadays, with the power of AI, I'm also considering whether I can build a frontend app for Mac with AI's assistance. It interests me to use computers to create useful or fun things.

## Status

The project is still actively under development and cannot even be considered version 0.0.1 yet. Many basic functions are still in progress, and I will only work on this in my spare time or when I'm willing to. So, don't expect rapid version or feature releases.
